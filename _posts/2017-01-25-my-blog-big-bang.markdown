Just switching from WordPress to Jekyell and GitHub pages. 
I hope this will be a promising move encourging me to write a little bit more.

I followed the simple instructions on [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and inspired also by my Readify colleague [Mohamed Zaatar](http://mzaatar.github.io/#blog).

In the next post I will do post on using TensorFlow to predict a textual description to an image and expose that as a usable SharePoint addin.

Stay tuned :)
